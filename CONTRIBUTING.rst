Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix
it? Do it! We will appreciate it. Any significant improvement should be
documented as `a GitHub issue <https://github.com/jesuejunior/everest/issues>`_ before
anybody starts working on it.

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests. We do our best to process them
quickly. If your pull request is not accepted on the first try,
don't get discouraged!
